Before beginning any migration, assess your current observability maturity:

#### Technical Assessment
- **Data Volume**: Current telemetry data volume (GB/month)
- **Applications**: Number and complexity of monitored applications
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud resources, containers, and services
- **Integrations**: Existing tool integrations and dependencies
- **Custom Dashboards**: Number of custom dashboards and reports
- **Alert Rules**: Complexity and number of existing alerts

#### Organizational Assessment
- **Team Skills**: Current expertise in monitoring tools
- **Budget**: Available budget for migration and ongoing costs
- **Timeline**: Urgency and available migration windows
- **Risk Tolerance**: Acceptable downtime and data loss thresholds

### Migration Decision Matrix

| Factor | Azure Native â†’ Dynatrace | Dynatrace â†’ Azure Native |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Primary Driver** | Advanced AI/ML capabilities | Cost optimization |
| **Complexity** | Medium | High |
| **Timeline** | 3-6 months | 6-12 months |
| **Risk Level** | Low-Medium | Medium-High |
| **Skill Requirements** | Dynatrace training | Azure + KQL training |
| **Data Migration** | Minimal | Significant |

```powershell
# Deploy hybrid architecture
.\scripts\deploy-hybrid-architecture.ps1

# Configure selective monitoring
.\scripts\configure-selective-monitoring.ps1

# Set up cross-platform alerting
.\scripts\configure-hybrid-alerting.ps1
```

### Hybrid Strategy 2: Phased Migration

Gradually migrate applications based on priority and complexity:

#### Phase 1: Non-Critical Applications â†’ Azure Native
```powershell
